# Introduction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
What effect do music concert tours have on the local economy?

- Recent **Taylor Swift** and **Beyoncé** tours suggest that large concert tours have a **significant impact on the local economy** through ticket sales, hotel bookings, etc.

- We hypothesize that, because of this economic impact, we can **use concert attendance to model local macroeconomic trends** (e.g. GDP)

# Project Goals

1. Use concert attendance and revenue data to __predict GDP growth__ in the state where the concert occurred
2. Use Twitter data about concert tours to __predict concert attendance__ in advance

# Models

## Bagging Regressor

- Using linear regression as base learners
- In terms of training error, performed about the same as the neural networks at a RMSE of 0.755 when predicting GDP growth from trend data

## Neural Netowrks

- Feed forward design
- Numerous configurations tested, out of these a 4 layer network performed the best
- More sophisticated than the bagging regressor and with a root mean squared training error of 0.753 when predicting GDP growth from trend data

# Limitations

- __Data Granularity__: We were limited to GDP data on a state level and on a quarterly time scale
  - It is difficult to determine just how much of an impact the concerts had on GDP growth versus general business cycle shifts

- __Training Data Size__: We limited our concert data to large-scale concert tours between 2015 and 2019 with available attendance and revenue figures (8 concerts)

- __Confounding Factors__: Our research problem lends itself to numerous confounding factors that are difficult to disentangle:
  - Do the concerts actually add economic impact beyond what would otherwise be expected?
  - e.g. most concerts happen in the summer (Q3)

- __Google Trends vs. Twitter__: We originally wanted to use NLP on tweets to extract more fine-grained data

# Opportunities for Future Work

- __Testing Hypothesis on Post-Pandemic Concerts__: We hope to use the Taylor Swift and Beyoncé concert tours as a test set for our models. We postulate that worldwide concert tours after 2020 might have a greater impact on economic trends as economies recover, and concerts stimulate a more disproportionate level of consumer spending compared to before 2020.

- __Additional/Different Trend Data Sources__: Given that tweets provide hyper-local data (e.g. geotags) and a larger quantity of individual data points, better matches between tweet activity and concert attendance can be expected.
